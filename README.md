### Slides
[PowerPoint slides from week 1 available here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!ArA04Pn7kyMsg7sljI9Lf8qupeDBNw).
If the link opens powerpoint online, you may click "File" on the top left, and "save a copy" to download it for yourself. Please see the notes for links to the images.

### Readings
1. This article is a nice introduction that takes on the question “why study astronomy”: ["Cosmic Perspective" Neil deGrasse Tyson, Natural History Magazine, April 2007](http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/universe/201367/cosmic-perspective) (This essay and others have recently been re-released in Tyson’s book “Astrophysics for Those in a Hurry”).
2. For next week's topic on the life cycle of stars, why not start close to home:
[“From Here to Eternity: The Fate of the Sun and Earth” Gregory P. Laughlin, Sky and Telescope, June 2007](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArA04Pn7kyMssjqr_Vxhz7VfvrX2)

### Class notes

Scaled solar system on google maps: [https://umanitoba.ca/observatory/outreach/solarsystem/](https://umanitoba.ca/observatory/outreach/solarsystem/) 

If you want to recreate what I showed, use latitude 42.41769 and longitude -71.1618, set the sun diameter to 380mm (about 15 in), then click "calculate", and then click "draw orbits"

### Other Resources
"365 Starry Nights" By Chet Raymo. This book taught me the night sky. (You can find it like I did, used for a few dollars.) I like how it's not glossy with eye-popping visuals that of course disappoint when you look up from a city. It’s a simple, open-the-book-to-any-page, and learn a mix of constellations and astronomy tidbits. I’ll bring a copy or two next week. (Some may recognize the author because he wrote “Science Musings” in the Globe until ~2003)
